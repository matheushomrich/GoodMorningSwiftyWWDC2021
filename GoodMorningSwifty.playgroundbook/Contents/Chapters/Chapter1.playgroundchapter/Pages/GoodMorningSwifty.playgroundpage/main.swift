//:  * This Playgound Book was designed for you to have an awesome Swift learning/practicing waking up experience!
//:  * In this and the following pages all you have to do is click on run my code and follow the instructions on the page!
//:  * The spirit of the project is to create a unique and different learning experience alongside a wake up routine with the most amaazing programming language out there, Swift!
//:  * I would like to give a huge thank you to my friend Rian Cordoni who kindly permitted me to use his song here, the song's name is DC3 and is available in [here](https://soundcloud.com/user-183182855/dc3).
//:  * I hope you enjoy using my application and have a good day!
